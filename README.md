# Blochain Applications in Dubai's SMEs Funding
This project is a part of the [Regional Immersion Project](https://www.spjain.edu.au/programs/postgraduate/gmba/academics/projects) at [SPJ](https://www.spjain.edu.au/). The project is designed to deep dive into the local business environment in Dubai (and the wider region) for “global intelligence” and an insight into different industries and business cultures.


## Project Objectives
The purpose of this project is to determine key reasons hindering UAE's Small-and-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in funding and investigate the potentials of blockchain applications to solve the current challenges. 


### Methodologies 
* In-depth interviews with SMEs, banks, and blockchain experts in the Emirate region were conducted and a globally online survey of 105 blockchain specialists was carried out.
* Statistical techniques(z-test and perception test) were employed to verify, validate, and test the reliability of the constructs and their indicators. To validate this framework, principal component analysis and empirical research were applied.
* **Methods and Tools**: Secondary and Primary Research, Hypotheis Testing, ADANCO, PHStat

### Data Analysis
Utilising Perception Testing to evaluate respondents' response and test the hypotheses.

### Project Outcomes

The majority of hypotheses were supported, only H4 and H8 were rejected, confirming the current funding challenges and suggesting the potential applications of smart contract and ICO for Dubai's SMEs in fundraising.

### Impacts
The findings give new insights into UAE’s SME sector and provide state-of-the-art suggestions to address its funding challenges. This research project is primarily targeted at the  SME sector, the Emirati Government as well as segmental-and-national policymakers in UAE. Nonetheless, consultants, segment stakeholders, and students who are interested in SMEs and disruptive technologies will also find this paper useful.
